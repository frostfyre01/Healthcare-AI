            <h2>More Strategies</h2>
            <p>Before entering the stock trading competition, I created several new trading strategies based on the same trading logic, focusing mainly on highly correlated Index ETFs. Most of these strategies produced comparable results, with a Profit Factor (PF) exceeding 2.5 and a win rate above 65%. This supports the effectiveness of the trading logic.</p>
            <p>Here, I have included a couple of equity curves and the Annualized Rate of Return (ARR).</p>

            <h2>Stock Trading Competition</h2>
            <img src="@/assets/images/trading/competition.png">
            <p>For the stock trading competition, over 300 high school students each receive $1,000,000 in virtual funds to invest using a simulator with real-time pricing data. Trading begins on June 4, 2024, and ends on July 26, 2024.</p>
            <p>Using the newly developed trading strategies, I achieved a <b>17% profit</b> over a 2-month period and won first place. During the same period, the benchmark broad market index fund SPY gained less than 4%.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>The trading strategy I demonstrated is an extremely simplified and unpolished version. I recognize that there are many areas for improvement, including entry, exit, and position managementâ€”each of which requires a deep understanding of trading. However, it provides a baseline upon which we can build, compare, and refine further.</p>
            <p>The most valuable knowledge I gained is understanding how to evaluate a trading system. With numerous indicators available for stock trading, I now have a systematic approach to determine which ones perform best under various market conditions and to understand the trading logic behind these indicators. This insight will aid in decision-making and help stabilize trading outcomes. I was thrilled to apply theoretical knowledge in a real-world trading environment and gain practical experience.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead, this approach will incorporate not only traditional data analytics but also machine learning techniques such as <b>Reinforcement Learning (RL)</b>, further enhancing the evaluation process.</p>
