            <h2>More Strategies</h2>
            <p>Before entering the stock trading competition, I created several new trading strategies based on the same trading logic, focusing mainly on highly correlated stock ETFs. Most of these strategies produced comparable results, with a Profit Factor (PF) exceeding 2 and a win rate above 65%. This supports the effectiveness of the trading logic and has significantly boosted my confidence in the strategy.</p>
            <p>Here, I have included two equity curves and the Annualized Percentage Return (APR).</p>

            <p>Once the stock trading competition starts, I can simply run all the trading strategies before the market closes each day to check for any signals to trade, thanks to the rule-based trading approach.</p>
            <p>Using the newly developed trading strategies, I achieved a <b>17%</b> profit over a 2-month period and won first place. During the same period, the benchmark broad market index fund gained less than 4%.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>This experience provided a valuable lesson on how systematic approaches can enhance stock trading results. I was thrilled to apply theoretical knowledge in a real-world trading environment and gain practical experience. I recognize that there are many areas for improvement in the strategy, including entry, exit, and position management. There are numerous systematic approaches available to refine these aspects.</p>
