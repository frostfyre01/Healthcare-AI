            <h2>Performance Metrics</h2>
            <p>The goal of a successful trading strategy is to achieve consistent profitability over time. Evaluating a trading strategy involves various factors. I will only focus on the fundamentals:</p>
            <div style="margin-left: 30px;">
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Return on Investment (ROI):</b> <i>Measures the percentage gain or loss relative to the initial investment.</i></li>
                    <li><b>Gross Profit:</b> <i>the sum of all profits from winning trades.</i></li>
                    <li><b>Gross Loss:</b> <i>the sum of all losses from losing trades.</i></li>
                    <li><b>Profit Factor:</b> <i>The ratio of gross profits to gross losses, indicating overall profitability.</i></li>
                    <li><b>Maximum Drawdown:</b> <i>Indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline in equity during a specific period.</i></li>
                    <li><b>Total Trade Number:</b> <i>The count of all executed trades within a specific period, reflecting trading activity.</i></li>
                    <li><b>Win/Loss Ratio:</b> <i>Compares the number of winning trades to losing trades.</i></li>
                    <li><b>Average Trade Profit/Loss:</b> <i>Calculates the average profit or loss per trade.</i></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Backtesting Essentials</h2>
            <p>To effectively evaluate a trading strategy, it’s important to use ample historical data covering diverse market conditions. Generating a sufficient number of trades within this data ensures that the results are statistically significant and reflective of various market scenarios.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Profitability</h2>
            <p>A <b>profit factor</b> greater than 1 indicates that the strategy generates more profit than loss, while a profit factor below 1 suggests that losses outweigh profits. A higher profit factor signifies a more favorable risk-to-reward ratio.</p>
            <img src="@/assets/images/trading/profit_factor.png">
            <p><b>Win Rate</b> represents the percentage of winning trades out of the total number of trades executed over a given period.</p>
            <img src="@/assets/images/trading/win_rate.png">
            <p>A high win rate indicates that a trading strategy has a higher proportion of winning trades compared to losing trades. While this suggests that the strategy is effective at identifying profitable opportunities. However it does not necessarily guarantee overall profitability. </p>
            <p>For example:
                <div class="code">
                    <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
                        <li>Winning Trades: 8 trades, each with an average profit of $50.</li>
                        <li>Losing Trades: 2 trades, each with an average loss of $300.</li>
                        <li>Win Rate = 80%, Total Profit = -$200 (net loss)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>                    
            </p>
            <p>Some strategies may have a low win rate but achieve high profitability by ensuring that the wins are significantly larger than the losses.</p>
            <div class="code">
                When a trading strategy shows a low win rate yet remains profitable, it is essential to determine whether the success is attributable to random chance or a solid underlying strategy. Key challenges include frequent drawdowns and psychological stress.
            </div>
            <p><b>Quick Summary:</b> With a profit pactor of 3.0 and a 72% win rate over the past 10 years, based on enough number of trades, this strategy appears effective, with good profitability and a high rate of successful trades.</p>
            <img src="@/assets/images/trading/result_spy_xyld.png">
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Return on Investment (ROI)</h2>
            <p>When calculating ROI, the Annualized Rate of Return (ARR) is typically used. This strategy has achieved an annual rate of 12.3% over the past 10 years. Additionally, it's important to consider factors such as the equity curve and drawdowns. Ideally, the equity curve should exhibit a consistent upward trend, and significant drawdowns should be minimized.</p>
            <img src="@/assets/images/trading/equity_spy_xyld.png">
            <p>When applying <b>linear regression</b> to the equity curve, the observed upward slope suggests that the strategy is likely to remain profitable over time.</p>            
        </div>        

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Trade Profit Percentage</h2>
            <p>Trade Profit Percentage is calculated as:</p>
            <img src="@/assets/images/trading/trade_percent.png">
            <p>Ideally, the trade profit percentage should be evenly distributed to ensure consistent performance and reduce volatility, balancing gains and losses effectively.Extremely large profits or losses are not favorable as they introduce significant volatility and risk, making it harder to maintain consistent performance and manage overall trading strategy effectively.</p>
            <img src="@/assets/images/trading/score_spy_xyld.png">
            <p><b>Calculate Expected Return:</b> The expected return of the strategy can be computed using the formula:</p>
            <div class="code">
                Expected Return = (Win Rate × Average Profit Percentage) − (Loss Rate × Average Loss)
            </div>
            <div class="code">
                Expected Return = (0.72 × 2.69%) − (0.28 × 2.32%) = 1.29%
            </div>
            <p><i>This indicates that the strategy is projected to yield an average return of around +1.29% per trade. With a win rate of 72%, it offers a favorable risk/reward ratio, as the average gain exceeds the average loss.</i></p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>This simple trading strategy has shown good performance over the last decade. It has a <b>Profit Factor of 3.0</b>, meaning it earns more than three times as much from winning trades compared to losing trades. It <b>wins 72%</b> of the time, so it has a higher success rate than lossing trades. <b>On average, each trade yields a return of 1.29%</b>. The <b>103 trades</b> are evenly distributed, which helps in managing risk and avoiding large losses. Importantly, there are <b>no significant drawdowns</b>, indicating stable performance without major drops in equity. Overall, the strategy appears to be both profitable and reliable.</p>
            <p>We’ll see how it performs against new, untested data in a real-world stock trading competition.</p>
